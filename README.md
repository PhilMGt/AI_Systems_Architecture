## 🔹 Overview

This repository serves as the **foundational systems architecture** for advanced Artificial Intelligence development, integrating:

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Systems Engineering thinking
- MLOps & deployment pipelines
- Human–AI interaction (visual-first cognition)
- Long-term research readiness (China AI MSc pathway)

This is not a tutorial repository — it is a **living system**.

## 🔹 System Status (Baseline Verified)

✅ Python (Anaconda) environment operational  
✅ PyTorch installed and verified  
✅ HuggingFace Transformers installed  
✅ Streamlit app deployed successfully  
✅ MLflow installed for experiment tracking  
✅ GitHub ↔ Streamlit Cloud integration working  

**Baseline Test Output:**  
`System operational`
